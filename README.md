# Food_Influencer

In this project, two Persian food influencers are chosen. We want to divide their posts into 2 groups: 1. with details, 2. without details(by "details" we mean whether a post has detail keywords we defined) and then each of these groups to 2 other groups based on having negative or positive keywords we defined. At the end we wll end up having these 4 post groups: 1. with details and positive, 2. without details and positive, 3. with details and negative, 4. without details and negative. Then for these groups we'll calculate following measures: 1. positive comments ratio, 2. number of likes to followers, 3. number of comments to followers.
At the end we made some conclusions by interpreting and comparing these measures considering all groups. If you are interested, here is the article link: doi link.
